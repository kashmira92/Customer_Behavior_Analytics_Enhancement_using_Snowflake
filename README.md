Project Overview
In this project, JSON files containing user data from AWS S3 buckets were retrieved and processed using Snowflake. The data pertains to the Virtual Reality domain, providing insights into customer behavior within this space. Key goals of the project include:

Efficiently organizing data into tables with variable column attributes.
Enriching the dataset using APIs to extract additional timezone data based on gamers' IP addresses.
Applying comprehensive data transformations through MERGE, JOINS, and CTAS operations.
Automating data workflows using Snowflake TASKS, STREAMS, and PIPES.
Curating and optimizing an analytics dashboard for effective visualization and KPIs tracking.
Data Ingestion and Transformation
Data Ingestion
The project begins with the retrieval of JSON files from AWS S3 buckets, which contain user data related to the Virtual Reality domain. The data is then efficiently organized into tables in Snowflake, accommodating variable column attributes.

Data Transformation
Enrichment: Additional timezone data is extracted based on gamers' IP addresses using various APIs. This enrichment provides valuable context to the data.
Transformations: Data undergoes comprehensive transformations using MERGE, JOINS, and CTAS operations. These operations ensure the data is in a clean, organized state and ready for advanced analytics.
Automation using Snowflake
To streamline the data workflows, the project uses Snowflake's TASKS, STREAMS, and PIPES features:

STREAMS: Continuously track changes in data and apply them as needed.
PIPES: Automate data ingestion from AWS S3 buckets into Snowflake tables.
TASKS: Schedule periodic data transformations, allowing for up-to-date insights and data management.
These features help maintain an efficient and automated data pipeline.

Analytics Dashboard
The project includes a curated and optimized analytics dashboard that effectively captures key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard provides actionable insights and visualizations that lead to quicker decision-making and improved overall efficiency.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Some key performance indicators (KPIs) that are tracked and visualized in the analytics dashboard include:

User Engagement: Tracking user interaction within the Virtual Reality domain.
Time Spent: Analyzing the time spent by users on different VR experiences.
Geographic Distribution: Understanding the geographic distribution of users.
Peak Usage Times: Identifying times of high user activity for optimized server usage.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of using Snowflake for data management and analytics, particularly in the Virtual Reality domain. The combination of efficient data organization, transformation, and automation leads to impactful insights and improved decision-making.
