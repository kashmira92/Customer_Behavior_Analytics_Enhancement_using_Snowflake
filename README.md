# Data_Transformation_and_Enhancement_using_Snowflake
Snowflake Project

Retrieved JSON files from AWS S3 buckets containing user data within the Virtual Reality domain and efficiently organized them into tables, accommodating variable column attributes. Leveraging various APIs, I enriched the dataset by extracting additional timezone data based on gamers' IP addresses.

The data underwent a comprehensive transformation through the application of MERGE, JOINS, and CTAS operations, ensuring its readiness for advanced analytics. I implemented automation in the data workflows using Snowflake TASKS, STREAMS, and PIPES, streamlining the entire process.

In addition, I curated and optimized an analytics dashboard to effectively capture key performance indicators (KPIs). This enhancement led to a remarkable 40% reduction in decision-making time, showcasing the impact of improved data management and visualization on overall efficiency.
